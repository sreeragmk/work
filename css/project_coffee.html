        <h2>History of Coffee</h2>
    </center>
    <center>
        <p>Coffee first arrived in Europe from the Muslim world during the 17th century. It was amazing and it amazed,
            with an exoticness that charmed Europeans, its stimulating effect and the fact that it made a welcome change
            from traditional alcoholic beverages. Establishments serving coffee began to open, providing an environment
            for wonderful social, cultural and political exchange and, within a century, coffee had become part of
            everyday life.</p>

        <!-- <h2>The Discovery of Coffee</h2> -->
    </center>
    <center>
        <p>It is not known exactly when coffee as a drink was discovered. However, we do know that the coffee plant
            originated in Ethiopia, where coffee beans were consumed either as a paste or as a drink, for their
            medicinal properties. The shrub was introduced to Yemen around the 14th century and it was then that the
            first coffee plantations were created. Muslim mystics and pilgrims appreciated coffee for its energising
            powers, so it travelled to Mecca. From that moment onwards, its success became unstoppable, bowling over
            Cairo, the Middle East and Constantinople, before arriving in Europe in the early 17th century.

            As expected, this new drink would come up against a few opponents. Religious clerics were suspicious and
            asked Pope Clement VIII to taste it. He allegedly declared that it would be a sin if only unbelievers were
            allowed to enjoy such a delicious drink. Like the pope, the privileged classes were charmed by coffee and
            quickly embraced its exoticism; ’turqueries’ were particularly fashionable at that time. Intellectuals
            appreciated it for its ability to help one stay alert and to think clearly.

            Unlike chocolate, which remained a luxury for the privileged for a long time, coffee, which was
            less-expensive, was adopted by all levels of society and welcomed into homes during the 19th century. A
            morning cup of coffee gradually replaced traditional broths or soups and became established as a great
            classic.
